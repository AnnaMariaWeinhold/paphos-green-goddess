heading="The garden"

<Paragraph 
text="In the garden — Zone Two, the second ring — of our design, much of the magic happens. Here I focus on growing seasonal vegetables in as sustainable manner as possible using no-till methods and harvesting rainwater to keep irrigation to a minimum. There are three garden/orchard spaces, planted with a variety of local and other trees which give cover to birds and wildlife as well as providing shade for the flowers, herbs, and plants that grow beneath them."

<HeadingThree 
heading="The field"
/>

<Paragraph 
text="The field, Zone Three, is our commercial production area. Certified organic since 2006, we have a range of perennial trees and vines that we harvest throughout the year. The New Year sees the start of the avocado harvest, and spring heralds a burst of activities as the different varieties of wine grapes begin to sprout their leaves. The grapes are picked and the wine made during July and August — sometimes even into September, thus overlapping with the mango season, which runs from mid-August into October. The year closes with the olives: first the table olives ripen at the end of October, and the last weekend in November sees the picking of the olives for oil. They are cold-pressed in a local mill, and the extra virgin oil is stored in stainless steel tanks for use throughout the year."
